# 🔒 AI-Powered Privacy Risk Classifier for Social Media Posts

## 📘 Overview
In the modern digital era, individuals share large amounts of personal information on social media platforms. Many users are unaware of how seemingly harmless posts can expose **sensitive data**, such as locations, banking details, or personal identifiers.  

This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to classify social media posts as **“Safe”** or **“Risky”**, helping users protect their **digital footprint** and maintain online privacy.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Users often post content containing private information without realizing potential security threats.  
For example:
- “Just got my new debit card!” → Risky  
- “Had a great day at work!” → Safe  

**Problem:**  
There is no automated system that can assess the privacy risk of social media posts in real-time.

**Goal:**  
Develop an AI model that can predict whether a post is **safe** or **risky** before publishing.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Collect and preprocess a dataset of social media posts.  
2. Extract meaningful textual features using NLP techniques.  
3. Build and train a Machine Learning classifier.  
4. Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.  
5. Provide a prediction interface for new user inputs.
